If the languages seen are different, that is ok.  Use the languages you see.
It is not required that all tests pass, maybe you will find a bug somewhere.  If a test isn't passing, add a comment explaining why.

## Requirements

1. Use TestNg `@DataProvider(s)` for **every** `@Test` method you write.
   i. However, do **not** use Excel as a DataProvider.  We do not have it installed.  We cannot see your data.  **The submission will be immediately rejected if Excel is used.**
2. Write a test method that verifies the languages are present by asserting their text value, based on a known list of languages.
   i. There should be a test result per language.
3. Write a test method that verifies the hyperlinks for the Featured Languages work, that is, they return a HTTP 200 status.
   i. There should be a test result per language.
4. Add methods or new classes where you think it is appropriate.
5. The final tests must execute when `mvn test` is run.
